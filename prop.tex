\begin{abstract}
  Karp et al. (1988) described Deferred Data Structures for Multisets
  as ``lazy'' data structures which partially sort data to support
  online rank and select queries, with the minimum amount of work in
  the worst case over instances of size $n$ and number of queries $q$
  fixed (i.e., the query size). Barbay et al. (2016) refined this
  approach to take advantage of the gaps between the positions hit by
  the queries (i.e., the structure in the queries). We develop new
  techniques in order to further refine this approach and to take
  advantage all at once of the structure (i.e., the multiplicities of
  the elements), the local order (i.e., the number and sizes of runs)
  and the global order (i.e., the number and positions of existing
  pivots) in the input; and of the structure and order in the sequence
  of queries. Our main result is a synergistic deferred data structure
  which performs much better on large classes of instances, while
  performing always asymptotically as good as previous solutions. As
  intermediate results, we describe two new synergistic sorting
  algorithms, which take advantage of the structure and order (local
  and global) in the input, improving upon previous results which take
  advantage only of the structure (Munro and Spira 1979) or of the
  local order (Takaoka 1997) in the input; and one new multiselection
  algorithm which takes advantage of not only the order and structure
  in the input, but also of the structure in the queries.  We
  described two compressed data structures to represent a multiset
  taking advantage of both the local order and structure, while
  supporting the operators \texttt{rank} and \texttt{select} on the
  multiset.

\section{Thesis statement}

Consider a \emph{multiset} $\mathcal{M}$ of size $n$ (e.g.,
$\mathcal{M}=\{1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ of size $n=10$).
%
% Frequency, Input Structure.
The \emph{multiplicity} of an element $x$ of $\mathcal{M}$ is the
number $m_x$ of occurrences of $x$ in $\mathcal{M}$ (e.g.,
  $m_3=2$). We call the distribution of the multiplicities
of the elements in $\mathcal{M}$ the \emph{input
  structure}\begin{LONG}
  , and denote it by a set of pairs $(x,m_x)$ (e.g., $\{(1,1)$,
  $(2,1)$, $(3,2)$, $(4,1)$, $(5,1)$, $(6,1)$, $(7,1)$, $(8,1)$,
  $(9,1)\}$ in $\mathcal{M}$)\end{LONG}.
%
As early as 1976, Munro and
Spira~\cite{1976-JComp-SortingAndSearchingInMultisets-MunroSpira}
described a variant of the algorithm {\tt{MergeSort}} using counters,
which optimally takes advantage of the input structure
\begin{LONG}
  (i.e., the multiplicities of the distinct elements)
\end{LONG}
when sorting a multiset $\mathcal{M}$ of $n$ elements. Munro and Spira
measure
the ``difficulty'' of the instance in terms of the ``input structure''
by the entropy function
$\mathcal{H}(m_1, \dots, m_\sigma) =
\sum_{i=1}^\sigma{\frac{m_i}{n}}\log{\frac{n}{m_i}}$. The time
complexity of the algorithm is within
$O(n(1 + \mathcal{H}(m_1, \dots, m_\sigma))) \subseteq
O(n(1{+}\log{\sigma})) \subseteq O(n\log{n})$, where $\sigma$ is the
number of distinct elements in $\mathcal{M}$ and
$m_1, \dots, m_\sigma$ are the multiplicities of the $\sigma$ distinct
elements in $\mathcal{M}$ (such that $\sum_{i=1}^\sigma {m_i}=n$),
respectively.

%% Local Input Order, Runs
Any array $\mathcal{A}$ representing a multiset lists its element in
some order, which we call the \emph{input order} and denote by a tuple
(e.g., $\mathcal{A}=(2,3,1,3,7,8,9,4,5,6)$). Maximal sorted subblocks
in $\mathcal{A}$ are a local form of input order and are called
\emph{runs}~\cite{1973-BOOK-TheArtOfComputerProgrammingVol3-Knuth}
(e.g., $\{(2,3)$, $(1,3,7,8,9)$, $(4,5,6)\}$ in $\mathcal{A}$).
%
As early as 1973,
Knuth~\cite{1973-BOOK-TheArtOfComputerProgrammingVol3-Knuth} described
a variant of the algorithm {\tt{MergeSort}} using a prepossessing step
taking linear time to detect \emph{runs} in the array $\mathcal{A}$\begin{LONG}, which he named \texttt{Natural MergeSort}.
  Mannila~\cite{1985-TCom-MeasuresOfPresortednessAndOptimalSortingAlgorithms-Mannila}
  refined the analysis of the \texttt{Natural MergeSort} algorithm to
  yield a time complexity for sorting an array $\mathcal{A}$ of size $n$
  in time within $O(n(1+\log\rho))\subseteq O(n\lg n)$, where $\rho$
  is the number of \emph{runs} in the $\mathcal{A}$\end{LONG}.
Takaoka~\cite{2009-Chapter-PartialSolutionAndEntropy-Takaoka}
described a new sorting algorithm that optimally takes advantage of the distribution of
the sizes of the runs in the array $\mathcal{A}$, which yields a time complexity within
$O(n(1+\mathcal{H}(r_1, \dots, r_{\rho}))) \subseteq
O(n(1{+}\log{\rho})) \subseteq O(n\log{n})$, where $\rho$ is the
number of runs in $\mathcal{A}$ and $r_1, \dots, r_{\rho}$ are the sizes
of the $\rho$ \emph{runs} in $\mathcal{A}$ (such that
$\sum_{i=1}^\rho {r_i}=n$), respectively.
\begin{LONG}
  It is worth noting that in 1997,
  Takaoka~\cite{1997-TR-MinimalMergesort-Takaoka} first described this
  algorithm in a technical report.
\end{LONG}

%% The questions
This suggests the following questions:
\textbf{\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is there a sorting algorithm for multisets which takes the
    best advantage of both its \emph{input order} and its \emph{input
      structure} in a synergistic way, so that it performs as good as
    previously known solutions on all instances, and much better on
    instances where it can take advantage of both at the same time?
  \item Is there a multiselection algorithm and a deferred data structure
    for answering \texttt{rank} and \texttt{select} queries which
    takes the best advantage not only of both of those notions of
    easiness in the input, but additionally also of notions of
    easiness in the queries, such as the \emph{query structure} and
    the \emph{query order}?
  \end{enumerate}
}

%% Our Results
We answer both questions affirmatively: 
%
In the context of \textsc{Sorting}, this improves upon both algorithms from Munro and Spira~\cite{1976-JComp-SortingAndSearchingInMultisets-MunroSpira} and Takaoka~\cite{2009-Chapter-PartialSolutionAndEntropy-Takaoka}. 
%
In the context of \textsc{MultiSelection} and \textsc{Deferred Data
  Structure} for \texttt{rank} and \texttt{select} on
\textsc{Multisets}, this improves upon Barbay et al.'s
results~\cite{2016-JDA-NearOptimalOnlineMultiselectionInInternalAndExternalMemory-BarbayGuptaRaoSorenson}
by adding 3 new measures of difficulty (input order, input structure
and query order) to the single one previously considered (query
structure). Even though the techniques used by our algorithms are
known, the techniques used to refine the analysis of these algorithms
to show that they improve the state of the art are complex.
%
Additionally, 
%
we correct the analysis of the \texttt{Sorted Set Union} algorithm by Demaine et al.~\cite{2000-SODA-AdaptiveSetIntersectionsUnionsAndDifferences-DemaineLopezOrtizMunro}, and
%
we define a simple yet new notion of ``global'' input order, formed by the number of
  preexisting pivot positions in the input (e.g. $(3,2,1,6,5,4)$ has
  one pre-existing pivot position in the middle), not
mentioned in previous
surveys~\cite{1992-ACMCS-ASurveyOfAdaptiveSortingAlgorithms-EstivillCastroWood,1992-ACJ-AnOverviewOfAdaptiveSorting-MoffatPetersson} nor extensions \cite{2013-TCS-OnCompressingPermutationsAndAdaptiveSorting-BarbayNavarro}.
