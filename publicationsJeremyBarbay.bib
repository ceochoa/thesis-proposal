  title =        {Dynamic Online Multiselection in Internal and External Memory},
  booktitle = walcom,
  year =         2014,
  abstract = "We consider the dynamic version of the \emph{online multiselection} problem for internal and external memory, in which~$q$ selection queries are requested on an unsorted array of $N$~elements. Our internal memory result is $1$-competitive with the offline result of Kaligosi\etal [ICALP 2005].  In particular, we extend the results of Barbary\etal [ESA 2013] by supporting arbitrary \emph{insertions} and \emph{deletions} while supporting online \emph{select} and \emph{search} queries on the array. Assuming that the insertion of an element is immediately preceded by a search for that element, we show that our dynamic online algorithm performs an optimal number of comparisons, up to lower order terms and an additive~$O(N)$ term.

For the external memory model, we describe the first online multiselection algorithm that is $O(1)$-competitive. This result improves upon the work of Sibeyn [Journal of Algorithms 2006] when $q > m$, where $m$ is the number of blocks that can be stored in main memory. We also extend it to support searches, insertions, and deletions of elements efficiently."

In particular, we match the bounds (up to lower order terms) from the optimal offline algorithm proposed by Kaligosi et al. [ICALP 2005]. We provide experimental results comparing online and offline algorithms. These experiments show that our online algorithms require fewer comparisons than the best-known offline algorithms. Interestingly, our experiments suggest that our optimal online algorithm (when used to sort the array) requires fewer comparisons than both quicksort and mergesort.}

 abstract = {In many applications, properties of an object being
modeled are stored as labels on vertices or edges of a graph. In this
paper, we consider succinct representation of labeled graphs. Our main
results are the succinct representations of labeled and multi-labeled
graphs (we consider vertex labeled planar triangulations, as well as
edge labeled planar graphs and the more general k-book embedded
graphs) to support various label queries efficiently. The additional
space cost to store the labels is essentially the
information-theoretic minimum. As far as we know, our representations
are the first succinct representations of labeled graphs. We also have
two preliminary results to achieve the main results. First, we design
a succinct representation of unlabeled planar triangulations to
support the rank/select of edges in ccw (counter clockwise) order in
addition to the other operations supported in previous work. Second,
we design a succinct representation for a k-book embedded graph when k
is large to support various navigational operations more
efficiently. In particular, we can test the adjacency of two vertices
in O(lg(k)lg(lg(k))) time, while previous work uses O(k) time.}

  abstract =  {We prove the existence of an algorithm A for computing
                  2-d or 3-d convex hulls that is optimal for every
                  point set in the following sense: for every set S of
                  n points and for every algorithm A' in a certain
                  class C, the maximum running time of A on input
                  s_1,...,s_n is at most a constant factor times the
                  maximum running time of A' on s_1,...,s_n, where the
                  maximum is taken over all permutations s_1,...,s_n
                  of S. In fact, we can establish a stronger property:
                  for every S and A', the maximum running time of A is
                  at most a constant factor times the average running
                  time of A' over all permutations of S. We call
                  algorithms satisfying these properties
                  instance-optimal in the order-oblivious and
                  random-order setting. Such instance-optimal
                  algorithms simultaneously subsume output-sensitive
                  algorithms and distribution-dependent average-case
                  algorithms, and all algorithms that do not take
                  advantage of the order of the input or that assume
                  the input is given in a random order.  The class C
                  under consideration consists of all algorithms in a
                  decision tree model where the tests involve only
                  multilinear functions with a constant number of
                  arguments. To establish an instance-specific lower
                  bound, we deviate from traditional Ben-Or-style
                  proofs and adopt an interesting adversary
                  argument. For 2-d convex hulls, we prove that a
                  version of the well known algorithm by Kirkpatrick
                  and Seidel (1986) or Chan, Snoeyink, and Yap (1995)
                  already attains this lower bound. For 3-d convex
                  hulls, we propose a new algorithm.  To demonstrate
                  the potential of the concept, we further obtain
                  instance-optimal results for a few other standard
                  problems in computational geometry, such as maxima
                  in 2-d and 3-d, orthogonal line segment intersection
                  in 2-d, finding bichromatic L_\infty-close pairs in
                  2-d, off-line orthogonal range searching in 2-d,
                  off-line dominance reporting in 2-d and 3-d,
                  off-line halfspace range reporting in 2-d and 3-d,
                  and off-line point location in 2-d.  }

Previous work propose and compare deterministic algorithms for this problem, in an adaptive
analysis based on the encoding size of a certificate of the result (cost analysis). We define the
alternation analysis, based on the non-deterministic complexity of an instance. In this analysis we
prove that there is a deterministic algorithm asymptotically performing as well as any randomized
algorithm in the comparison model. We define the redundancy analysis, based on a measure of
the internal redundancy of the instance. In this analysis we prove that any algorithm optimal
in the redundancy analysis is optimal in the alternation analysis, but that there is a randomized
algorithm which performs strictly better than any deterministic algorithm in the comparison
model. Finally, we describe how those results can be extended beyond the comparison model.

paper, we consider succinct representation of labeled graphs. Our main
results are the succinct representations of labeled and multi-labeled
graphs (we consider vertex labeled planar triangulations, as well as
edge labeled planar graphs and the more general k-book embedded
graphs) to support various label queries efficiently. The additional
space cost to store the labels is essentially the
information-theoretic minimum. As far as we know, our representations
are the first succinct representations of labeled graphs. We also have
two preliminary results to achieve the main results. First, we design
a succinct representation of unlabeled planar triangulations to
support the rank/select of edges in ccw (counter clockwise) order in
addition to the other operations supported in previous work. Second,
we design a succinct representation for a k-book embedded graph when k
is large to support various navigational operations more
efficiently. In particular, we can test the adjacency of two vertices
in O(lg(k)lg(lg(k))) time, while previous work uses O(k) time.}

  abstract = {We define and design succinct indexes for several
abstract data types (ADTs).  The concept is to design auxiliary data
structures called succinct indexes that occupy asymptotically less
space than the information-theoretic lower bound on the space required
to encode the given data, and support an extended set of operations
using the basic operators defined in the ADT.  As opposed to succinct
encodings, The main advantage of succinct indexes is that we make
assumptions only on the ADT through which the main data is accessed,
rather than the way in which the data is encoded.  This allows more
freedom in the encoding of the main data.  In this paper, we present
succinct indexes for various data types, namely strings, binary
relations and multi-labeled trees.  Given the support for the
interface of the ADTs of these data types, we can support various
useful operations efficiently by constructing succinct indexes for
them.  When the operators in the ADTs are supported in constant time,
our results are comparable to previous results, while allowing more
flexibility in the encoding of the given data.

Using our techniques, we design the first succinct encoding that
represents a string of length $n$ over alphabet $[\sigma]$ using
$nH_k+o(n\log\sigma)$ bits that support access / rank / select operations in
$o((\log\log \sigma)^3)$ time.  We also design the first succinct text
index using $nH_k+o(n\log\sigma)$ bits that supports pattern matching
queries in $O(m\log\log\sigma + occ\log^{1+\epsilon}n\log\log\sigma)$ time,
for a given pattern of length $m$.  Previous results on these two
problems either have a $\log\sigma$ factor instead of $\log\log\sigma$ in
terms of running time, or are not compressible, but our results do not
have such problems.  More results are reported in the paper.

  abstract = { The "Intersection of sorted arrays" problem has
applications in indexed search engines such as Google. Previous works
propose and compare deterministic algorithms for this problem, and
offer lower bounds on the randomized complexity in different models
(cost model, alternation model). We refine the alternation model into
the redundancy model to prove that randomized algorithms perform
better than deterministic ones on the intersection problem. We present
a randomized and simplified version of a previous algorithm, optimal
in this model.}  }

  abstract = {Consider the problem of computing the intersection of k
sorted sets. In the comparison model, we prove a new lower bound which
depends on the non-deterministic complexity of the instance, and
implies that the algorithm of Demaine, L२pez-Ortiz and Munro is
usually optimal in this ``adaptive'' sense. We extend the lower bound
and the algorithm to the t-Threshold Problem, which consists in
finding the elements which are in at least t of the k sets. These
problems are motivated by boolean queries in text database systems.}

  abstract = { We propose a discrete variant of the {Bak-Sneppen} model
for self-organized criticality. In this process, a configuration is an
n-bit word, and at each step one chooses a random bit of minimum value
(usually a zero) and replaces it and its two neighbors by independent
Bernoulli variables with parameter p. We prove bounds on the average
number of ones in the stationary distribution and present experimental
results.}
